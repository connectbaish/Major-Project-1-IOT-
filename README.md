# 🌦️ Weather Forecasting with IoT and ThingSpeak

This project demonstrates how to set up a weather forecasting system using IoT sensors and the ThingSpeak platform. It collects weather-related data from various sensors, analyzes the data, and predicts future weather conditions.

## 🌟 Overview

### Features
- Collects data on temperature, humidity, air pressure, wind speed, and rainfall.
- Uses ThingSpeak for data storage and visualization.
- Implements predictive modeling for weather forecasting.
- Sends alerts based on specific weather conditions.

## 📦 Hardware Requirements

To set up your system, you'll need the following components:

- **IoT Development Board**: Arduino Uno, Raspberry Pi, ESP32, etc.
- **Weather Sensors**:
  - Temperature Sensor (e.g., DHT22)
  - Humidity Sensor (e.g., BME280)
  - Barometric Pressure Sensor (e.g., BMP280)
  - Wind Speed Sensor (e.g., Anemometer)
  - Rain Gauge (e.g., Tipping bucket)
- **Power Supply**: Battery pack or solar panel
- **Communication Modules**: ESP8266 for Wi-Fi or GSM module for cellular connectivity
- **Enclosures**: Weatherproof housing for sensors

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

1. **Select and Deploy Sensors**: Choose the appropriate sensors and install them in suitable locations for accurate readings.
2. **Connect to ThingSpeak**: Set up ThingSpeak channels for each type of data you wish to collect. Configure the sensors to send data at regular intervals.
3. **Data Analysis**: Use ThingSpeak’s tools to analyze the collected data and create visualizations.
4. **Develop Forecasting Models**: Implement machine learning algorithms to predict future weather conditions based on historical data.
5. **Setup Alerts**: Create alerts for specific weather conditions using ThingSpeak.

## 📊 Data Visualization

Visualize the data collected from your sensors using ThingSpeak’s built-in MATLAB analytics and visualization tools.

## 🔧 Considerations

- Ensure proper placement of sensors for accurate data.
- Monitor power consumption and consider energy-efficient solutions.
- Regularly update your models based on new data.
